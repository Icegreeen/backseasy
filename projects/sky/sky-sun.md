#### How to implement:

With tailwind installed in your project (tutorial), implement these tailwind classes in your parent div where it will reflect the background.


```

export default function Background() {
  return (
    <section
      className="flex flex-col items-center h-screen"
      style={{
        backgroundImage: `
        radial-gradient(circle at top, #8a5101 35%, #733000 45%, #000 75%)
        `
      }}
    >
      
  {your component / page}
    </section>
  );
}

```
