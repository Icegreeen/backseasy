#### How to implement:

With tailwind installed in your project (tutorial), implement these tailwind classes in your parent div where it will reflect the background.

Code:

```
<section className="bg-white w-full bg-cover bg-center h-screen dark:bg-gray-950 bg-[url('https://flowbite.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/jumbotron/hero-pattern.svg')] dark:bg-[url('https://flowbite.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/jumbotron/hero-pattern-dark.svg')]">
          {your page}
        <div className="bg-gradient-to-r dark:from-teal-950 w-full h-full absolute top-0 left-0 z-0"></div>
    </section>
```

View background:
